# Frontend Exercices - TripAdvisor

An exercise to recreate the TripAdvisor website. It's part of my training to become a web and mobile developer with the school "Le Reacteur"

_This website is just an exercice and will not be deployed or use beside as a portfolio entry_

## Overview

This project is mobile first and responsive.

All the external webpages linked to this exercice are not made by me but are actual TripAdvisor webpage.
The buttons are not working for the moment.

## To Do

- Code a form popup that ask for personal information
- Put the website online
- Create a backend to receive the informations sent by the form
- Send those informations to me by mail
